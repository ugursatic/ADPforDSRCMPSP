File contents : 
Projectcasedetails.xlsx file contains the problem attributes of each tested problem. 
Welch's t-test for mean differences with max profit.xlsx file contains simulation results of 11 ADP models on the tested problem and compares the results from the minimum and maximum results.
Welch's t-test for mean differences with model 3.xlsx file contains simulation results of 11 ADP models on the tested problem and compares the results with Model 3. 
coefficients.xlsx file contains the coefficients of ADP models. 
Zip files are the problem files used in simulation comparison, and Larger Size Problems.pdf holds the information about which file represents which problem.
Comparison to Optimal Problems.pdf contains the case details of the small-size problem. This information is also available in Projectcasedetails.xlsx.
